# Send to qBittorrent

This extension integrates with your qBittorrent client via the WebUI API, allowing you to quickly add torrent and magnet links. It features a user-friendly interface to configure your API credentials.

## IMPORTANT:
You **must** disable Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in qBittorrent for the API calls to work properly. You can either disable it manually in your qBittorrent settings or use the **"Disable CSRF"** button in the extension's UI after entering your API credentials.
